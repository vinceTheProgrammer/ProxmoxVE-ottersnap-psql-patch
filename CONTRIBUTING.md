# Contributing to Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts

Welcome! We're glad you want to contribute. This guide covers everything you need to add new scripts, improve existing ones, or help in other ways.

For detailed coding standards and full documentation, visit **[community-scripts.org/docs](https://community-scripts.org/docs)**.

## How Can I Help?

> [!IMPORTANT] > **New scripts** must always be submitted to [ProxmoxVED](https://github.com/vinceTheProgrammer/ProxmoxVE-ottersnap-psql-patchD) first — not to this repository.
> PRs with new scripts opened directly against ProxmoxVE **will be closed without review**.
> **Bug fixes, improvements, and features for existing scripts** go here (ProxmoxVE).

## Prerequisites

Before writing scripts, we recommend setting up:

- **Visual Studio Code** with these extensions:
  - [Shell Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmalehorn.shell-syntax)
  - [ShellCheck](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)
  - [Shell Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format)

---

## Script Structure

Every script consists of two files:

| File                         | Purpose                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ct/AppName.sh`              | Container creation, variable setup, and update handling |
| `install/AppName-install.sh` | Application installation logic                          |

Use existing scripts in [`ct/`](ct/) and [`install/`](install/) as reference. Full coding standards and annotated templates are at **[community-scripts.org/docs/contribution](https://community-scripts.org/docs/contribution)**.

## Contribution Process

### Adding a new script

New scripts are **not accepted directly in this repository**. The workflow is:

1. Fork [ProxmoxVED](https://github.com/vinceTheProgrammer/ProxmoxVE-ottersnap-psql-patchD) and clone it
2. Create a branch: `git switch -c feat/myapp`
3. Write your two script files:
   - `ct/myapp.sh`
   - `install/myapp-install.sh`
4. Test thoroughly in ProxmoxVED — run the script against a real Proxmox instance
5. Open a PR in **ProxmoxVED** for review and testing
6. Once accepted and verified there, the script will be promoted to ProxmoxVE by maintainers

Follow the coding standards at [community-scripts.org/docs/contribution](https://community-scripts.org/docs/contribution).

### Fixing a bug or improving an existing script

Changes to scripts that already exist in ProxmoxVE go directly here:

1. Fork **this repository** (ProxmoxVE) and clone it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProxmoxVE
   cd ProxmoxVE
   ```

2. Create a branch:

   ```bash
   git switch -c fix/myapp-description
   ```

3. Make your changes to the relevant files in `ct/` and/or `install/`

4. Open a PR from your fork to `vinceTheProgrammer/ProxmoxVE-ottersnap-psql-patch/main`

Your PR should only contain the files you changed. Do not include unrelated modifications.

---

## Code Standards

Key rules at a glance:

- One script per service — keep them focused
- Naming convention: lowercase, hyphen-separated (`my-app.sh`)
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Quote all variables: `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
- Use lowercase variable names
- Do not hardcode credentials or sensitive values

Full standards and examples: **[community-scripts.org/docs/contribution](https://community-scripts.org/docs/contribution)**

## Developer Mode & Debugging

Set the `dev_mode` variable to enable debugging features when testing. Flags can be combined (comma-separated):

```bash
dev_mode="trace,keep" bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinceTheProgrammer/ProxmoxVE-ottersnap-psql-patch/main/ct/myapp.sh)"
```

| Flag         | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trace`      | Enables `set -x` for maximum verbosity during execution      |
| `keep`       | Prevents the container from being deleted if the build fails |
| `pause`      | Pauses execution at key points before customization          |
| `breakpoint` | Drops to a shell at hardcoded `breakpoint` calls in scripts  |
| `logs`       | Saves detailed build logs to `/var/log/community-scripts/`   |
| `dryrun`     | Bypasses actual container creation (limited support)         |
| `motd`       | Forces an update of the Message of the Day                   |

## Notes

- **Website metadata** (name, description, logo, tags) is managed via the website — use the "Report Issue" link on any script page to request changes. Do not submit metadata changes via repo files.
- **JSON files** in `json/` define script properties used by the website. See existing files for structure reference.
- Keep PRs small and focused. One fix or feature per PR is ideal.
- PRs with **new scripts** opened against ProxmoxVE will be closed — submit them to [ProxmoxVED](https://github.com/vinceTheProgrammer/ProxmoxVE-ottersnap-psql-patchD) instead.
- PRs that fail CI checks will not be merged.
